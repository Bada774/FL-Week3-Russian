translate korean d16s01_d53b0e53:

translate korean d16s01_0b0f857f:


    sy "Meaning that when Fetish Locator sends anything to you or receives anything from you, the Fetish-Locator-Locator-Inator™ secretly writes all that info down."


translate korean d16s01_34351075:

translate korean d16s01_e4faede9:

translate korean d16s01_b1ae83f7:


    sy "Basically, along with logging all incoming and outgoing data from Fetish Locator, Fetish-Locator-Locator-Inator™ also tries to decrypt the data."


translate korean d16s01_1951407e:


    sy "The problem, however, is that we're trying to brute-force our way in and uh... It's not fast, to say the least."

    mc "What do you mean?"


translate korean d16s01_3a0819eb:

    mc "\"Unknown\"?"


translate korean d16s01_cf05969f:

translate korean d16s01_3bc70fb6:


    sy "It could work the moment you open FL, it could take months..."


translate korean d16s01_f4487708:


    arj "Still, this is our best chance."


translate korean d16s01_7b74d818:


    sy "Yeah. And I don't necessarily think that it'll take a super long time to crack."


translate korean d16s01_515e4cc2:

translate korean d16s01_293939e8:

translate korean d16s01_e2008202:

translate korean d16s01_e31627a6:

translate korean d16s01_5002f737:

translate korean d16s01_dfb80f38:


    sy "Yeah, no. You need different kinds of data."


translate korean d16s01_42ddb90f:


    sy "The same stuff over and over again won't help."


translate korean d16s01_0733307d:


    arj "So, complete challenges, buy stuff, and just interact with Fetish Locator as much as you can I suppose."


translate korean d16s01_4898b166:

translate korean d16s01_577fe339:
